     * the connection to Google Fit may be lost without any callback. Going through the authorization will ensure that
     * the app is connected again.

     * Gets all the data points of a certain data type within a certain time window.
     * Warning: if the time span is big, it can generate long arrays!
     *
     * Quirks of query()
     *
     * In iOS, the amount of datapoints is limited to 1000 by default.
     * You can override this by adding a limit: xxx to your query object.
     * In iOS, datapoints are ordered in an descending fashion (from newer to older).
     * You can revert this behaviour by adding ascending: true to your query object.
     * In Android, it is possible to query for "raw" steps or to select those as filtered by the Google Fit app.
     * In the latter case the query object must contain the field filtered: true.
     * In Google Fit, calories.basal is returned as an average per day, and usually is not available in all days.
     * In Google Fit, calories.active is computed by subtracting the basal calories from the total.
     * As basal energy expenditure, an average is computed from the week before endDate.
     * While Google Fit calculates basal and active calories automatically,
     * HealthKit needs an explicit input from some app.
     * When querying for activities, Google Fit is able to determine some activities automatically
     * (still, walking, running, biking, in vehicle), while HealthKit only relies on the input of
     * the user or of some external app.
     * When querying for activities, calories and distance are also provided in HealthKit (units are kcal and meters) and
     * never in Google Fit.
     * When querying for nutrition, Google Fit always returns all the nutrition elements it has,
     * while HealthKit returns only those that are stored as correlation. To be sure to get all stored the quantities
     * (regardless of they are stored as correlation or not), it's better to query single nutrients.
     * nutrition.vitamin_a is given in micrograms in HealthKit and International Unit in Google Fit.
     * Automatic conversion is not trivial and depends on the actual substance.

     * Gets aggregated data in a certain time window. Usually the sum is returned for the given quantity.
     *
     * Quirks of queryAggregated()
     * In Android, to query for steps as filtered by the Google Fit app, the flag filtered:
     * true must be added into the query object.
     * When querying for activities, calories and distance are provided
     * when available in HealthKit and never in Google Fit.
     * In Android, the start and end dates returned are the date of the first and the last available samples.
     * If no samples are found, start and end may not be set.
     * When bucketing, buckets will include the whole hour / day / month / week / year where start and end times
     * fall into. For example, if your start time is 2016-10-21 10:53:34,
     * the first daily bucket will start at 2016-10-21 00:00:00.
     * Weeks start on Monday.
     * When querying for nutrition, HealthKit returns only those that are stored as correlation.
     * To be sure to get all the stored quantities, it's better to query single nutrients.

     * In iOS you cannot store the total calories, you need to specify either basal or active. If you use total calories, the active ones will be stored.
     * In Android you can only store active calories, as the basal are estimated automatically. If you store total calories, these will be treated as active.
     * In iOS distance is assumed to be of type WalkingRunning, if you want to explicitly set it to Cycling you need to add the field cycling: true.
     * In iOS storing the sleep activities is not supported at the moment.
